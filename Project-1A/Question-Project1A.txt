CVEN 647 â€“ NUMERICAL METHODS IN GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING
PROJECT IA
Write a MATLAB program for a finite difference analysis of a laterally loaded pile in
clay. Use a first-order finite difference formulation. Soil springs should be formulated in
terms of the Matlock (1970) or equivalently, API curves for lateral bearing and loaddeflection
in a soft clay.

Inputs to the program should include:
1. A user- specified undrained shear strength profile.
2. Pile properties including length L, elastic modulus E, and moment of inertia I.
3. Fixed versus free-head conditions.
4. Applied lateral load at surface, H, or applied displacement at surface, y0.

Outputs should include profiles of:
1. Deflected shape of pile, y.
2. Bending moments, M.
3. Shear, V.
4. Equivalent soil pressure, P.

Do an analysis for the following test case:
1. A 36-inch outer diameter, 100-ft long, circular steel pile, with a 1.5-inch wall
thickness.
2. The undrained shear strength profile shown below:
su0 = 100 psf, with strength gradient k = 10 psf/ft.
3. Load the pile under free-head conditions to a surface deflection y0 = 2 inches. Plot
the profile of y, M, V, and P for this case. For your test case demonstrate that your
iteration procedure converges to a stable solution.
4. Repeat Part 3 for fixed-head conditions.
