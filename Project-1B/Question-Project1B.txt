CVEN 647 – NUMERICAL METHODS IN GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING
PROJECT IB
Write a MATLAB program for a finite difference analysis of an axially loaded pile in
clay. Use a first-order finite difference formulation. Soil springs should be formulated in
terms of the API curves for axial load transfer for side and tip resistance.
Inputs to the program should include:
 A user- specified undrained shear strength profile.
 Adhesion factor  and tip bearing factor Nc.
 Pile properties including length L, elastic modulus E, and area A.
 Applied displacement at surface, z0.
Outputs should include the following as a function of displacement:
 Profile of side resistance versus depth
 Total side resistance
 Tip resistance
 The sum of tip and total side resistance
Do an analysis for the same test case as Project IA:
 A 36-inch outer diameter, 100-ft long, circular steel pile, with a 1.5-inch wall
thickness.
 The undrained shear strength profile shown below:
 su0 = 100 psf, with strength gradient k = 10 psf/ft.
 Adhesion factor  = 0.85 and tip bearing factor Nc =9.
 Load the pile under displacement control until ultimate load capacity is reached.
Plot side resistance, tip resistance and total resistance as a function of vertical
displacement at the top of the pile. Assume the pile is plugged in your tip
resistance calculation.
