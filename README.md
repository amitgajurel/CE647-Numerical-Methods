# CE647-Numerical-Methods
This is the repository project done in CE647-Numerical-Methods class at Texas A&amp;M University College Station Fall 2021. The class is based on MATLAB but I am trying to replicate the script in Python - making it more accessible to a wider group of people. The class is divided into different projects.
